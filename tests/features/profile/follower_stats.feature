Feature: Follower count
  As a user,
  I want to know more about the followers in an org,
  So it helps me make a decision on whether I want to follow the org or not

  Scenario: User (Non-Follower) visits a Public Org page
    Given the user is not a follower
    And the organization is public
    When the user clicks on the follower count
    Then a list containing the public identity of individual followers is visible to them

    Given the user is a follower
    And the organization is public

  Scenario: User (Non-Follower) visits a Private Org page
    Given the user is not a follower
    And the organization is private

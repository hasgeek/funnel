Feature: Account unfollow
  As a user,
  I want to unfollow from an organization,
  So I stop receiving notifications of the orgs activities across all communication channels

  Scenario: Logged in user unfollows a public organization
    Given the user is logged in
    And the organization is public
    When the user visits the organization page that they are following
    And clicks the 'Unfollow' button in the dropdown
    Then the user sees a success message 'Unfollowed' on the org page
    And the primary button state on the page changes to 'Follow'

  Scenario: Logged in user unfollows a private profile
    Given the user is logged in
    And the organization is private
    When the user visits the organization page that they are following
    And clicks the 'Unfollow' button in the dropdown
    Then the user sees a success message 'Unfollowed' on the org page
    And the primary button state on the page changes to 'Follow'
    And the user can no longer see the projects in the org

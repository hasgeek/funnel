    Test whether process_recipient produces output compatible with sanitize_address.

    `sanitize_address` behaves differently between Python versions, making
    testing tricky, so `process_recipient` tests its output against `sanitize_address`
    before returning it. It will always work in a given Python version, but this test
    can't assert the exact output. FIXME: Needs a consistent implementation and test.

Copyright © 2010-2020 by Hasgeek

This code is open source under the AGPL v3 license (see LICENSE.txt). We welcome your examination of our code to:

* Establish trust and transparency on how it works, and
* Allow contributions

To establish our intent, we use the AGPL v3 license, which requires you to release all your modifications to the public under the same license. You may not make a proprietary fork. To have your contributions merged back into the master repository, you must agree to assign copyright to Hasgeek, and must assert that you have the right to make this assignment. (We realise this sucks, so if you have a better idea, we’d like to hear it.)

Our workflow assumes this code is for use on a single production website. Using this to operate your own website is not recommended. Brand names and visual characteristics are not covered under the source code license.

We aim to have our source code useful to the larger community. Several key components are delegated to the Coaster library, available under the BSD license. Requests for liberal licensing of other components are also welcome. Please file an issue ticket.

This repository uses Travis CI for test automation and has dependencies scanned by PyUp.io.

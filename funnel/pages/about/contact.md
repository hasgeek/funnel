title: Contacting Hasgeek

We try to be as accessible as possible.

For general enquiries, email us at [info@hasgeek.com](mailto:info@hasgeek.com). For priority support requests, use [support@hasgeek.com](support@hasgeek.com). Prefer social media? We’re [@hasgeek](https://twitter.com/hasgeek) on Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Hasgeek).

You can also call us at [+91 7676 33 2020](tel:+917676332020). This goes straight to the mobile numbers of all team members. If all of us are unable to take a call (or you hang up before we answer), we’ll call you back as soon as we can.

Want to send us something? We are at:

> Hasgeek House
> \#2699, 19th Main, 5th Cross, Indiranagar HAL 2nd Stage
> Bangalore - 560 008, Karnataka, India
> Ph: +91 7676 33 2020

We’re unfortunately unable to take appointments for any product or service you’d like to pitch us, so please don’t call or email about that. No physical visits either: as a remote-first company, this is only our official location. The team works from home.

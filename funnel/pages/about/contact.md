title: Contacting HasGeek

We try to be as accessible as possible.

For general enquiries, email us at [info@hasgeek.com](mailto:info@hasgeek.com). For priority support requests, use [support@hasgeek.com](support@hasgeek.com). Prefer social media? We’re [@hasgeek](https://twitter.com/hasgeek) on Twitter and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HasGeek). We host the [Friends of HasGeek](https://friends.hasgeek.com) Slack team that anyone can join.

You can also call us at [+91 7676 33 2020](tel:+917676332020). This goes straight to the mobile numbers of all team members. If all of us are unable to take a call (or you hang up before we answer), we’ll call you back as soon as we can.

We are unfortunately unable to take appointments for any product or service you’d like to pitch us, so please don’t call or email about that.

We host an Open House almost every Friday (the exception being when we are all travelling or hosting an event out of office). Drop in on Fridays 5 PM onwards:

> HasGeek House  
> \#2699, 19th Main, 5th Cross, Indiranagar HAL 2nd Stage  
> Bangalore - 560 008, KA, India  
> Ph: +91 7676 33 2020

This is also where you send us any parcels. Unexpected goodies are always nice.

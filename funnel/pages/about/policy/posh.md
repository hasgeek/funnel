title: Prevention of sexual harassment policy

We believe in creating fair and equitable environments within the organization, for folks who interact with us on contract and for our larger communities. To that end, our Prevention of Sexual Harassment policy (Link the entire policy here) details our intention and commitment to safety and dignity of all persons. We have simplified the policy below for easy readability, so that anyone associating with Hasgeek is under no doubt that harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, is forbidden in this organization and the communities we foster and every employee, contractor and community member has the right to be protected against it.

## Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy

The purpose of this policy is to prevent any acts of sexual harassment and to provide redressal in the event of sexual harassment at the workplace. At Hasgeek, we nurture safety, dignity and the drawing of clear boundaries with zero tolerance of misconduct of any sort.

This policy has been created in accordance with the provisions of The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

We have extended the policy to include folks of all genders. While legal redressal is available only to women, as per the POSH Act of 2013, within the bounds of our policy and our ICC, the right to exist in a discrimination-free environment and raise a complaint rests with all genders.

If a party is not present for more than 3 consecutive hearings, without sufficient cause, the Committee may, after giving that party a notice of 15 days, give an ex parte decision on the complaint.

### Disciplinary Action

Where any misconduct is found by the Committee, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against the accused, up to and including termination. This action shall be in addition to any legal recourse sought by the complainant.

In case the ICC finds the degree of offence coverable under the Indian Penal Code, then this fact shall be mentioned in its report and appropriate action shall be initiated by the management of the organization, for making a Police complaint as may be appropriate.

## Safeguards

### Protecting the complainant

It is the role of the ICC to ensure that the complainant or the witness are not victimized or discriminated against.

**Option to seek transfer or leave**: During the conciliation and inquiry, the complainant can seek transfer or leave so that the inquiry process can continue smoothly and to prevent recurrence of similar situations or discomfort to the complainant.

The leave can extend for a maximum period of 3 months. Leave granted under this provision will be paid leave and will not be counted in the number of leaves that the complainant is statutorily entitled to.

The Committee has the discretion to grant leave of an appropriate duration, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, or grant an alternate measure such as transferring the employee or the accused, as it deems fit.

**Option to work from home**: The complainant may be required to work from home, if it is practical, keeping in mind the nature of work of the complainant, health and mental condition. However, the complainant is under a good faith obligation and shall not abuse the process.

**Protection from a hostile environment**: The Committee shall also take note of the inherent power asymmetry and/or the vulnerability of the complainant in such cases and take steps to ensure that the aggrieved person is not subjected to a hostile environment during the investigation.

**Protection from retaliation**: Regardless of the outcome of the complaint made in good faith, the employee lodging the complaint and any person providing information or any witness, will be protected from any form of retaliation.

**Protection from retaliatory action**: Any unwarranted pressures, retaliatory or any other type of unethical behaviour by the respondent against the complainant while the investigation is in progress should be reported by the complainant to the ICC as soon as possible.

Retaliation cases must be treated as seriously as an alleged case of sexual harassment even if the original harassment complaint is not proven.

**Confidentiality**: The contents of the complaint made, the identity of the complainant, respondent and witnesses, any information relating to conciliation and inquiry proceedings, recommendations of the ICC and the action taken by the employer shall not be published, communicated or made known to the public, press and media in any manner.

Any person contravening the confidentiality clause is subject to disciplinary action as prescribed in the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.

### Protecting the respondent

If the ICC finds that the complainant has maliciously given a false complaint against the accused, disciplinary action shall be taken against the complainant as well.

**Establish malicious intent through a separate inquiry**: While deciding malicious intent, the Committee should consider that mere inability to substantiate a complaint need not mean malicious intent.

**Recommend disciplinary action against the complainant**: If the ICC arrives at the conclusion that the allegation against the respondent is malicious, they must recommend the employer to take appropriate action against the complainant.

## Roles and Responsibilities

title: Cancellation, return and refund policy

At Hasgeek we believe in offering value in exchange for value. These are our cancellation, return and refund policies with regards to our various services.

Refunds, where eligible, are typically issued via the same instrument that was used to make the payment (so the refund will go to your card or bank for an online payment). However, we are sometimes unable to do this and may offer you a cheque, bank transfer, cash, or credit coupon, at our discretion.

## Events

We offer a 100% refund on attendee ticket cancellations until the day before the event, but some events may have a specific policy that overrides this generic policy. Please check if the event you are cancelling for has a specific policy.

Please write to us at <support@hasgeek.com> to request a refund (or see the [contact info](/about/contact) page for other ways to contact us).

We may cancel an event due to unforeseen reasons or circumstances outside our control (force majeure events such as floods, fire, riots, terrorist incidents, bandhs, etc). If that happens, we may reschedule the event or issue a full or partial refund at our discretion.

## Merchandise

**Returns:** If you are unhappy with the merchandise for any reason, you can return the item in an unused condition within 7 days of purchase for a replacement or a refund. Replacement is subject to availability. At the moment all returns must be in-person at our office or at our events.

Some items may be sold without the option of a return, and will be indicated as such in the item description or during the checkout process.

**Refunds:** Refunds are issued upon receipt of an item in a saleable condition (subject to the above exception). A restocking fee may apply.

## Sponsorships, advertising and job board

Offline bookings are not covered under this policy and will have specific terms revealed to you at the time of making the booking.

For online bookings, any unused credits are available for refund. Credits, once used, are deemed a final, irreversible sale.

## Support

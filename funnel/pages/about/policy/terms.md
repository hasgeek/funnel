HasGeek makes available APIs or interfaces that expose content and functionality from HasGeek’s Services to third party developers. If an API is likely to expose non-public information contributed by the User, we will obtain the User’s consent before enabling it. We will have rules governing the use of the API by such developers/companies/third party websites, but we cannot be held responsible for their use of the API in a manner that is inappropriate or violates an applicable law.

## Content and scope

HasGeek reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the materials posted on its Services. HasGeek shall have the right to remove or edit any content that in its sole discretion violates, or is alleged to violate, any applicable law or either the spirit or letter of these Terms of Service or [community guidelines](community). Notwithstanding this right of HasGeek, THE USER SHALL REMAIN SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF THE MATERIALS THAT IS POSTED ON THE HASGEEK SERVICES WHETHER SUCH CONTENT IS ACCESSIBLE AND/OR VISIBLE PUBLICLY OR OTHERWISE.

All trademarks reproduced in this Service which are not the property of, or licensed to, the operator are acknowledged on the Service wherever we have been made aware of a trademark claim.

## Third party dealings

From time to time this Service may also include links to other websites. These links are provided for the User’s convenience to provide further information. They do not signify that we endorse the website(s). We have no responsibility for the content of the linked website(s).

Through the User’s use of our Services or attendance at our events, with or without our intervention or facilitation, they may engage with other individuals or companies, including, for instance, advertisers or prospective employers. The User’s dealings with them are their business entirely.

## Payment and pricing

We charge for certain Services and provide other Services without charge. But whether we do charge or not is a commercial decision and we believe it is important that we reserve the right to change pricing and related policies if we feel the need to do so. We will alert the User when we are about to effect such changes that affect them.

HasGeek may provide more than one payment method as a convenience to the User. This may include online payment gateways operated by other companies. The operation of these payment transactions occurs outside our control and we only receive a confirmation of payment from the payment gateway provider. There are a number of reasons why the User’s payment transaction may fail and we may not be able to provide a suitable explanation for that failure. We are incorporated as an Indian entity and only accept payments in Indian currency.

## Fulfilment

For specific products and services, we provide product fulfilment terms that determine when a product or service is deemed to be delivered.

**Hasjob job board**

The terms of service specific to listing a job are listed under the [Hasjob terms of service](https://hasjob.co/tos).

**Events**

HasGeek organizes events e.g. conferences, workshops, hackathons and meetups for the community, and incurs expenses for venue, food, stationery & printing, audio & video facilities as well as other rental or purchased equipment. HasGeek reserves entry to select events only to valid ticket holders. A ticket is valid only for the persons named on the ticket issued by us.

Pricing for each event will be publicly available for a specified period before the event. Apart from making tickets available online, HasGeek may also hold a portion of the venue capacity for onsite ticket purchases. Tickets will be available for purchase until there is capacity at the venue, as defined by its safety guidelines or as set by HasGeek, whichever is lower.

Fulfilment for an event happens on the conclusion of the event associated with a validly purchased/issued ticket. That means that ‘technically’ the service has been provided once the event ends, even though we may provide the User with additional materials after the event.

**Advertising**

The terms of service specific to submitting an advertising or sponsorship request are listed under the [Advertising terms of service](adtos).

## Refunds

For our refund policy regarding cancellation and returns, please refer to our [Refunds policy](refunds).
